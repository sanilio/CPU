This is a CPU created using the HADES circuit
simulation framework.

Each component in the CPU was formed using
fundamental gates. Building upon each component
and placing them within a data path results
in a functional CPU.

The CPU is split between four sub-projects.
The main document contains a table of contents
to browse through each sub-project.
